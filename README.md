# Kiwi Mono

Monospaced supremacy for plain text!


## Main features

This theme was built with two main desires:

1. **Monospace font for editing mode.**
    - I like monospaced fonts for editing plain text. This includes changing spacings to be consistent with the character widths; all font sizes to be equal; et cetera.
    - Font weights work best with [Cascadia Mono](https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code)

2. **One accent color to rule them all**
    - I wanted to choose one accent color and let the theme generate shades of that color automatically.


## Minor elements

- Headings have less margins (level 3+ headings have no margins)

- Blockquotes and callouts look more similar

- Reading mode should work fine with any font; I prefer [Mona Sans](https://github.com/github/mona-sans) or [CMU Serif](https://sourceforge.net/projects/cm-unicode/)

- Flatter UI (sidebars and tab bar have same color as editor; less dividers)

- Some minor themeing for [Pandoc Reference List](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-pandoc-reference-list)

## About the CSS source

This theme mainly alters the content window with some very minor themeing for the sidebars and tab bar.

CSS files targeting individual elements are in the `src` folder. The `theme.css` file is generated by simply concatenating all files in the `src` folder.

Ideally, each css file would target separate elements and be independent from each other, with the `.markdown-source-view` scope for editing mode and `.markdown-reading-view` for reading mode. For clarity, even styles that are shared via variables are declared separately even if duplicated. 

Some elements, especially nested elements and those inside a prerenderd `.markdown-rendered` block may not be targetted cleanly by just the two main views. In such cases, the nested elements will be called *inside the CSS file of the parent element*, rather than its own file. For example:
```css
.markdown-source-view {
    .callout {
        ...
        code {
            ...
        }
    }
}
```
